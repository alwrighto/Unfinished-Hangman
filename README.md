# Unfinished Hangman

This is a template for a C# project to implement a hangman game.

On checkout, it will not work. Your mission (if you choose to accept it) is to complete the game so it is in a playable state.

## Rules
+ There are no rules, add or remove whatever code you feel like in any way you feel best.
+ TODO's are there to give you ideas, you do not have to implement the extension ideas, but they sound fun to me!

Hack away!
